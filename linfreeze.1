.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm LinFreeze
is a utility to
.Sq freeze
a user's home folder or any directory, meaning that the files and folders within that directory are 
.Pq recursively
prevented from being permanently changed. Any changes made to these files and folders are not permanent, and when the system is rebooted the files and folders are returned to their original state.
.Pp
.Nm LinFreeze
can do this by modifying
.Pa /etc/fstab
to lay a tmpfs layer on top of it where all temporary changes are stored and later discarded upon rebooting. The tmpfs layer is always located at /path/to/frozen/directory.dynamic. Optionally, a
.So static Sc
directory may be made where you may put read-only files to be layed above the original directory, but under the dynamic directory. The arguments 
.Op Fl d Ar directory
and
.Op Fl f Ar user
can be used to freeze a directory or a user, respectively.
.Pp
When a user or directory is frozen,
.Pa /etc/fstab.thaw
is created as a backup of the old
.Pa /etc/fstab
file. Lines containing the users and directories frozen are appended to the end of
.Pa /etc/fstab.
A list of dynamic directories is included in
.Pa /etc/.frozen
and a list of static directories, if any, is included in
.Pa /etc/.static.
.Pp
The argument
.Op Fl u
is used to un-freeze directories by replacing
.Pa /etc/fstab
with
.Pa /etc/fstab.thaw.
After it successfully completes, a message to reboot and use the
.Op Fl c
argument is shown.
.Op Fl c
removes the dynamic and, if applicable, static directories after they have been unloaded from rebooting.
