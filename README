DESCRIPTION
  LinFreeze is a script you can use to "freeze" a user's home directory or any other directory so that file changes are not permanent.
It does this by layering a tmpfs layer on top of the user's home folder (or the directory of your choosing), where all changes will be stored.
Optionally, you may use a "static" directory to be layered on top of the directory containing temporary, read-only files and folders.

DEPENDENCIES
  0-	aufs (aufs2 on Arch Linux)
  1-	bash
  2-	sed
  3-	a standard, Linux filesystem structure with /etc/fstab and user directories in /home
  And that's it!

INSTALL
  Copy "linfreeze" to /usr/bin or whatever folder you wish, and make sure that it is executable.

INSTRUCTIONS
  run 'linfreeze -h' to see a list of commands.
  'linfreeze -f [user]' lets you 'freeze' a user.
  'linfreeze -d [directory]' recursively 'freezes' a directory.
  'linfreeze -u' 'unfreezes' all users and removes their 'dynamic' directories.
  'linfreeze -c' removes the temporary directories for users and directories.

FUTURE PLANS
  0-	A manpage.
  1-	Allowing certain files and folders to be exempt from "freezing", if possible.
  2-	"Freezing" an entire partition.
  3-	A GUI of some sort, maybe using GTK or Zenity.
  4-	Listing the users and directories that are frozen.
  5-	'Unfreezing' specific users and directories.
