DESCRIPTION
  LinFreeze is a script you can use to "freeze" a user's home directory so that file changes are not permanent.
It does this by layering a tmpfs layer on top of the user's home folder, where all changes will be stored.
Optionally, you may use a "static" directory to be layered on top of the home folder containing temporary, read-only files and folders.

DEPENDENCIES
  0-	aufs (aufs2 on Arch Linux)
  1-	bash
  2-	a standard, Linux filesystem structure with /etc/fstab and user directories in /home.
  And that's it!

INSTALL
  Copy "linfreeze" to /usr/bin or whatever folder you wish, and make sure that it is executable.

FUTURE PLANS
  0-	A manpage.
  1-	"Freezing" specific folders in a directory.
  2-	Allowing certain files and folders to be exempt from "freezing", if possible.
  3-	"Freezing" an entire partition.
  4-	A GUI of some sort, maybe using GTK or Zenity.
